# odin-recipes
For this project, I am building a basic recipe website using HTML. The website will consist of a main index page with links to a few recipes
By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated new-found knowledge of setting up an HTML boilerplate, including a website title, headings, unordered/ordered lists, and links
